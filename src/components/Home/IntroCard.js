                    As mentioned, I'm new to the web developer world. Recently graduated from University of Texas, Austin's Full Stack Web Development bootcamp.

                    I am currently studying React.

                    I am looking to study next Python, C#, .Net, and Angular.

                    I am interested in backend roles but consider myself a full stack web developer.

                    My interest include Databases including SQL and MongoDB, Apollo GraphQL, Node.js, RESTFUL API and more.

                    Also if it isn't obvious already, I'm a bit of a Dachshund fan.
