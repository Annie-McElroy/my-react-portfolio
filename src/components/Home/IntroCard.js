          My name is Annie McElroy and I'm a newly developed web developer!
        </h2>
        <p>
          As mentioned, I'm new to the web developer world. Recently graduated
          from University of Texas, Austin's Full Stack Web Development
          bootcamp. I am currently studying React. I am looking to study next
          Python, C#, .Net, and Angular. I am interested in backend roles but
          consider myself a full stack web developer. My interest include
          Databases including SQL and MongoDB, Apollo GraphQL, Node.js, RESTFUL
          API and more. Also if it isn't obvious already, I'm a bit of a
          Dachshund fan.
